# Payment Integration with Adyen
  
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a secure and scalable payment integration with Adyen. The system will allow merchants to accept and manage online transactions across multiple payment methods (cards, wallets, and local payment options), while ensuring compliance with industry standards (PCI DSS, 3DS2).

## 1.2 Scope

The solution will provide:
- Payment initiation and processing (authorization, capture, cancellation, refund).
- Webhook handling for payment status updates.
- Secure storage of transaction metadata.
- APIs for frontend integration with checkout flows.

Out of scope:

- Manual settlement processes.
- Direct storage of sensitive cardholder data (handled by Adyen).

## 2. System Overview

The system will be composed of:

- Payment API – core service that interacts with Adyen.
- Webhook Handler – processes asynchronous Adyen notifications.
- Database Layer – stores transaction states, references, and logs.

Admin Dashboard (optional) – for internal monitoring and reconciliation.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Payment Operations

- FR-1: The system shall authorize a payment with Adyen when requested by a client application.
- FR-2: The system shall support capture of authorized payments.
- FR-3: The system shall support partial and full refunds.
- FR-4: The system shall handle cancellation of pending payments.

### 3.2 Webhooks

- FR-5: The system shall verify webhook authenticity using Adyen HMAC signatures.
- FR-6: The system shall update the transaction status in the database upon receiving a webhook.
- FR-7: The system shall retry processing failed webhook deliveries up to 3 times.

### 3.3 Security & Compliance

- FR-8: The system shall never store raw cardholder data.
- FR-9: The system shall support 3D Secure 2.0 flows.
- FR-10: The system shall encrypt all sensitive configuration values (API keys, secrets).

### 3.4 Reporting

- FR-11: The system shall provide an API endpoint to retrieve transaction history.
- FR-12: The system shall log all API interactions with Adyen for auditing.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: The system must process 100 transactions per second under normal load.
- NFR-2: Average API response time shall be less than 500ms.
- NFR-3: The system shall achieve 99.9% uptime.
- NFR-4: The system shall scale horizontally via container orchestration (Kubernetes or Docker Swarm).
- NFR-5: All code shall follow OWASP security best practices.
